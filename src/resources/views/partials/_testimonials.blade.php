                                <p>“Once we had realised the potential of live video, we found ourselves in a race to secure and install the ultimate solution ASAP.  Luckily, the choice turned out to be quite simple in the end. EyeRide’s military-grade system is on a par with the tough-as-nails equipment factory workers are used to dealing with, and the video functionality, archiving and unlimited data plans are just what we were looking for.”

                                <p>“EyeRide turned out to be everything we wanted – and more. The flow-on benefits of features such as second-by-second GPS updates have enabled us to streamline operations in ways we hadn’t even thought of before. With ‘Innovation in Operation’ being one of the main tenets here at Autobase, EyeRide really is right up our alley.”

                                <p>“With EyeRide, we’re truly equipped to stay as far ahead of the game as you possibly can. In fact, I can check the position and live audio and video feeds of every single vehicle in the fleet right here on my smartphone, and should I need to tell a particular driver anything, I just push a button. Details like that make for absolutely invaluable reassurance – both for our management and drivers as well as our clients and their cargo.”

                                <p>“EyeRide give us insights into what actually happens in the field that you won’t get even when riding along with a driver. Drivers know that you can see and hear everything, but they’re not bothered by your presence...and then there’s the holistic view that you get when every vehicle in the fleet feeds this wealth of data to you in real-time; it provides you with a depth of understanding that is simply unbeatable. Being closely familiar with the driver’s reality enables you to make decisions that not only sound good in the boardroom but actually work in practice, too.”
